                Hey there! I’m Mostafa, a web developer who turns code into captivating user experiences (with just a dash of magic).
                Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect designs or building seamless back-end solutions,
                I bring a passion for clean, responsive, and engaging websites.
                I’m here to tackle challenges, make the web a better place,
                and maybe even save a few projects from the dreaded "Page Not Found."
                Dive in to check out my work—let’s build something awesome together!
